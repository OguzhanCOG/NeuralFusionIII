# NeuralFusion™ III

A multimodal vision LLM with an extreme context window, built for a new era, designed to tackle the world's toughest challenges.

***Truly*** for those who dare.

## Performance

Building on NeuralFusion™ II's success in MMLU, qualitative testing, and other benchmarks, NeuralFusion™ III achieves performance comparable to Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, or Llama 3.1 405B.

## Core Highlights

- 1.4 ***trillion*** total parameters, with 82B active at inference via a novel MoE-mux architecture (72B without embeddings).
- A massive 1M token context window handling audio, video, text, 3D objects, and more. This is powered by an array of new token translation meta-networks, tailored to NeuralFusion™ III's revamped embedding system.
- A new 'Token Staggering' method extends output token limits to a cohesive 128K, significantly surpassing standard 8K/32K outputs.
- Updated extremeHEAD to version II, a next-generation Multi-Head Self-Attention head.
- Fully reworked embedding system, optimized for efficient multimodal integration and long-context coherence.
- Hybrid Transformer Core adapted directly from EnhanceFX™ VI for ultra-sharp, image-based contextual processing.
- ViRAU dynamic activation function.
- TFT ≈ 500ms on a RTX 4090. Yes.

### Features

CoT built in. Designed fundamentally to question everything, plan out responses, predict user reaction, cross-reference, search online, and research before answering. A truly proactive reasoning engine.

Sentiment Stability. Baked in at the architectural level: Concise when needed, thorough and pedantic when required. A model which emulates prior subjective experiences for the best logical experience. No more lengthy essays for simple confirmations. No more clichéd words like "delve" or "excited". This leads to a better intuition of what you mean, interpreting subtle nuances or implicit expectations with excellent emotional quotient.

ContextRefresh Preview. For when it absolutely matters, a true sentinel meta-network. No more missed context, forgotten instructions, or nonsensical outputs. Sanity checks are a thing of the past.

Audio and Video. A/V is not an afterthought. NeuralFusion™ III's architecture, featuring the EnhanceFX™ VI-inspired hybrid core for full temporal video understanding, natively processes audio (vocals, instruments, etc.) and video streams. This isn't about converting to text; it's about direct multimodal integration at the embedding level.

ParaSync II. Fully dynamic. Globally active. Ever had an LLM misunderstand when you elaborate? Or over-focus on a task, forgetting everything else? What if the LLM changed some of its parameters, just for you?

CodeMaster. How many times have you gone back and forth to perfect code bases? CodeMaster automatically runs tests internally, manages Git repositories for you, and only responds when fully confident.
